To play the project, open the x64 folder, then open the server folder, and run server.exe. The console will display an IP address that you can use to connect to the game. Then navigate to the Client folder inside the x64 folder and run client.exe. Input the IP address that the server pasted and hit Enter. Then open client.exe again (either on the same computer or a different computer) and paste the IP address again. The game should start. If you connected first (player 1) your paddle is on the left side. If you connected second (player 2) your paddle is on the right side.
